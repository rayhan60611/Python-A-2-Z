# Snake Water Gun Game Using Python

Snake Water Gun is one of the famous two-player game played by many people. It is a hand game in which the player randomly chooses any of the three forms i.e. snake, water, and gun. Here, we are going to implement this game using python. 

## This python project is to build a game for a single player that plays with the computer.

### Following are the rules of the game:

1. Snake vs. Water: Snake drinks the water hence wins.
2. Water vs. Gun: The gun will drown in water, hence a point for water
3. Gun vs. Snake: Gun will kill the snake and win.
4. In situations where both players choose the same object, the result will be a draw.

** We will use random.randint() method and nested if-else statements to select a random item from a list. **


### Playre Input :
Players Turn:
            1.Press "S" For Snake 
            2.Press "W" For Water 
            3.Press "G" for Gun   
            >>>>>>>>>>>>> w  

** W Means Player choose Water **


### Computer Will give a random Object Among Water, Snake Or Gun.
** Let's Assume Computer Has Given Gun **


### Output:
            Player Choose: Water!
            Computer Choose: Gun->
            Player Win !!!
